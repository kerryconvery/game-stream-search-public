### Commands
* `lerna bootstrap` - Install all dependencies
* `lerna run start:local` - Start a development build of the frontend pointing a backend api on localhost
* `lerna run start:prod` - Start a production build of the frontend pointing a backend api on prod
* `lerna run build:local` - Builds a production build of the frontend pointing a backend api on localhost
* `lerna run build:prod` - Builds a production build of the frontend pointing a backend api on prod
* `lerna run start:service --stream` - Builds and starts the backend service inside a docker container
* `lerna run stop:service --stream` - Stops the running service
* `lerna run test --stream` - run all unit tests
* `lerna run test:integration --stream` - run the integration tests (web service must be running first)
* `lerna run lint` - run the linter over the frontend code

### How to run the application with docker
1. Clone to repository to your local machine
2. Change to the folder into which the repository was cloned.
3. In the application root folder, create the file .env file containing your AWS credentials as follows:  
     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx`  
     `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx`
4. Run the application `docker-compose up`
5. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080
6. Stop the application `docker-compose down`

### How to develop the application
1. Clone to repository to your local machine
2. Change the to folder into which the repository was cloned.
3. Install all dependencies `lerna bootstrap`
4. In the application root folder, create the file .env file containing your AWS credentials as follows:  
     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx`  
     `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx`
5. Start the web service and web server `lerna run start:service --stream`
6. Start the web client `lerna run start:local`
7. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080
8. Stop the web service `lerna run stop:service`

### How to run the service through Visual Studio
1. Clone to repository to your local machine
2. Change the to folder into which the repository was cloned.
3. Install all dependencies `lerna bootstrap`
4. Ensure that you have configured the AWS credentials using `aws configuration`
5. Open the service in Visual Studio and run the application
6. Start the web client `lerna run start:local`
7. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080

### Deploy AWS infrastructure needed to support the application
1. Change to the folder /devops
2. Deploy infrastructure by running ```deploy-application-infrastructure.sh```

### Deploy application to AWS
1. Change to the folder /devops
2. Deploy the application by running ```deploy-application-components.sh <env name> <build no>``` e.g ./deploy-application-components.sh prodA 123
